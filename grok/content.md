Create a detailed preparation guide for the DP-700 exam, "Implementing Data Engineering Solutions Using Microsoft Fabric." The guide should cover all the following topics and subtopics, providing for each subtopic:

- A clear and concise explanation of the concept, including foundational knowledge suitable for someone new to Microsoft Fabric and data engineering.
- Real-world examples to demonstrate how the concept is applied in practical scenarios.
- At least two practice questions (one of which must be scenario-based) with detailed answers and explanations to help me test and understand the material.

Ensure the practice questions are designed to test the practical application of knowledge in real-world situations, reflecting the skills needed for the DP-700 exam. Structure the guide with clear headings for each topic and subtopic, making it easy to follow and study from.

**Topics and Subtopics:**

1. **Implement and manage an analytics solution**  
   - Configure Microsoft Fabric workspace settings (Spark, domain, OneLake, data workflow).  
   - Implement lifecycle management in Fabric (version control, database projects, deployment pipelines).  
   - Configure security and governance (workspace-level, item-level, row/column/object/folder/file access controls, dynamic data masking, sensitivity labels, endorse items, workspace logging).  
   - Orchestrate processes (choose pipeline vs. notebook, design schedules and event-based triggers, implement orchestration patterns with notebooks and pipelines, parameters, dynamic expressions).  

2. **Ingest and transform data**  
   - Design and implement loading patterns (full and incremental data loads, prepare data for dimensional model, loading pattern for streaming data).  
   - Ingest and transform batch data (choose data store, choose dataflows/notebooks/KQL/T-SQL, create/manage shortcuts, implement mirroring, ingest via pipelines, transform via PySpark/SQL/KQL, denormalize, group/aggregate data, handle duplicate/missing/late-arriving data).  
   - Ingest and transform streaming data (choose streaming engine, choose native/followed storage or shortcuts in Real-Time Intelligence, process via eventstreams, Spark structured streaming, KQL, create windowing functions).  

3. **Monitor and optimize an analytics solution**  
   - Monitor Fabric items (data ingestion, transformation, semantic model refresh, configure alerts).  
   - Identify and resolve errors (pipeline, dataflow, notebook, eventhouse, eventstream, T-SQL errors).  
   - Optimize performance (lakehouse table, pipeline, data warehouse, eventstreams/eventhouses, Spark performance, query performance).  

Please ensure the guide is comprehensive, self-contained, and written in a way that supports learning from the ground up while preparing me for the practical aspects of the exam through the practice questions.
